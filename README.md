## Technical Skills Demonstrated

In this project, I have showcased my frontend development skills by building a clean, interactive, and well-structured web application. Key technical skills demonstrated include:

1. **React.js**: Utilized React to build reusable, modular components that contribute to a maintainable and scalable application.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Organized the application using functional components, which allows for better reusability and separation of concerns within the project.
3. **Environment Variables**: Used a `.env` file to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as API keys, ensuring proper configuration and security in the development environment.
4. **CSS for Attractive Design**: Applied CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing design with a focus on user experience. Implemented responsive styling to ensure the app is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
5. **Responsive Design**: Employed media queries and fluid layouts to make the application mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
6. **Code Quality**: Followed best practices for clean, readable, and maintainable code. Emphasized modularity and separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend.
7. **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users, ensuring smooth interactions and improving the overall user experience.
8. **Git for Version Control**: Managed project development with Git to keep track of changes, handle collaboration, and ensure proper version control through GitHub.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
